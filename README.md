MWAN3 Telegram Notification Script

This script is designed for OpenWRT routers using the MWAN3 package to send Telegram notifications when the status of network interfaces changes. It monitors the status of your WAN interfaces (e.g., Biznet and Telkomsel ByU) and sends a message to a specified Telegram chat when any interface goes down or comes back up. This helps keep you informed about your networkâ€™s health, especially in cases where you have failover setups and want to ensure reliable connectivity.
